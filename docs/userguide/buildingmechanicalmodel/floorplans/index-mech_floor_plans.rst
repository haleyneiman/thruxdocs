Working in the Floor Plans
##########################

The mechanical floor plans provide a visual interface for load calculations. Here, the basis of design templates created in the :ref:`Elements Workspace <Mechanical_Elements>` can be associated with the spaces, walls, windows, and roofs in the building.

Assigning Space Types to Spaces
-------------------------------

Double click a space, and the :ref:`Properties Explorer <Properties-Explorer>` will open, displaying information about the selected space. Space types can be assigned one by one using this explorer or, they can be quickly assigned with the Quick Tag tool, shown below.
