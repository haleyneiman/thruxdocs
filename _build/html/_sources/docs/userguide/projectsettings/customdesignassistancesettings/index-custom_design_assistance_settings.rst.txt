Custom Design Assistance Settings
=================================

THRUX offers three (3) different levels of :ref:`Design Assistance <Design-Assistance>`: :ref:`Full Design Assistance <Full-Design-Assistance>`, :ref:`Custom Design Assistance <Custom-Design-Assistance>`, and :ref:`No Design Assistance <No-Design-Assistance>`.

Under normal conditions, THRUX is in :ref:`Full Design Assistance <Full-Design-Assistance>` mode and will calculate equipment sizes automatically.  :ref:`No Design Assistance <No-Design-Assistance>` mode allows full control of the model, and will still display Flags or code-violations.  However, in :ref:`Custom Design Assistance <Custom-Design-Assistance>` mode, certain parameters can be excluded from equipment sizing.

For example, if the designer would like a conduit size to remain constant or intentionally oversized to account for shaft space, deselect Conduit Size and turn Custom Design Assistance mode on as shown below.  As the designer is accommodating load, the conduit size will not recalculate.
